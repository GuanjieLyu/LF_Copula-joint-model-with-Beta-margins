# Copula-Based Joint Regression with Beta Margins: Simulation Code

This repository contains reproducible simulation code for "Joint Copula-Based Beta Regression with
Covariate-Dependent Dispersion for Malaria
Indicators". The code supports the simulation studies reported in the accompanying manuscript and is designed to evaluate finite-sample performance, numerical stability, and convergence behavior of likelihood-based joint models for bounded outcomes.
